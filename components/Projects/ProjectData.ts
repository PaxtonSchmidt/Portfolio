    role: `BugTracker is a role-based issue tracking platform for professional development teams and small-time collaborators. People who create a team on BugTracker can invite their teammates, manage roles and organize projects. BugTracker concerns itself with tracking issues, so users can focus on solving problems.`,
    difficulties: `The initial iteration of the app lacked a global state solution causing an array of issues that included a hard-to-manage tree of drilled props and repetitive requests to the server.`,
    solution: `Redux fixed both issues with some positive side effects. It increased the speed at which the application could horizontally expand because I no longer had to backpedal and refactor when implementing a new feature that required the old state.`,

    role: `This portfolio is a quick representation of my development works so far.`,
    difficulties: `The process of writing and reorganizing semantic CSS continues to slow my development process. While this has a lesser effect on a small project like this portfolio, I felt it could be an opportunity to learn Tailwindcss.`,
    solution: `The beauty of a class library like Tailwindcss is its synergy with ReactJS. Semantic CSS felt logical when writing pure HTML, but abstracting markup into React components makes it feel redundant.`
